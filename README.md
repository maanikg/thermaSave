# thermaSave

We wanted a way to help fellow Canadians decrease their carbon emission consumption and we thought we could create a model to do exactly that and use ML to optimize it!

ThermaSave - App | GitHub	Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
- Developed a Python app using machine learning algorithms to forecast energy usage of Toronto buildings based on weather forecasts for the next 30 years and provide suggestions for proactive energy management 
- Analyzed correlation between weather and energy usage for the past 50 years to determine the optimal machine learning model to fit both sets of data
- Self-taught random forest regression with pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn in under 24 hours for Hack the MIST 2023 hackathon
